# LocalizationDemo

With PimPrint, localised InDesign documents can be created. A document is initially generated in the so-called master language. Layout adjustments can be made manually in this
language. When generating additional languages, the positions and element sizes of the master language are used, whereby the manual layout adjustments are automatically adopted to
the additional languages.

The LocalizationDemo shows features of PimPrint to explain this concept and how it works.
